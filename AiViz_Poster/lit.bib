	abstract = {Vision-based robotic picking enables automation of commissioning and sortation of disordered parts. To locate parts for grasping, state-of-the-art approaches rely on convolutional neural networks for instance segmentation in 2D images. However, this requires sufficiently large training datasets, which are expensive to capture and annotate. Therefore, training with synthetic data is promising as the data can be generated automatically. We present an approach for the cut-paste method to create synthetic images for industrial use cases. With this approach, an end-user first prepares the image generation with just a smartphone and about 20 minutes of manual effort. Then, a versatile dataset with instance segmentation labels is generated automatically. In addition, a procedure for grasp pose computation is applied to enable robotic picking based on instance segmentation. For evaluation, training data is generated for a wide range of rigid parts and deformable linear objects. Testing with real-world data and practical experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed cut-paste method for industrial applications.},

	abstract = {Machine learning techniques are attractive options for developing highly-accurate analysis tools for nanomaterials characterization, including high-resolution transmission electron microscopy ({HRTEM}). However, successfully implementing such machine learning tools can be difficult due to the challenges in procuring sufficiently large, high-quality training datasets from experiments. In this work, we introduce Construction Zone, a Python package for rapid generation of complex nanoscale atomic structures which enables fast, systematic sampling of realistic nanomaterial structures and can be used as a random structure generator for large, diverse synthetic datasets. Using Construction Zone, we develop an end-to-end machine learning workflow for training neural network models to analyze experimental atomic resolution {HRTEM} images on the task of nanoparticle image segmentation purely with simulated databases. Further, we study the data curation process to understand how various aspects of the curated simulated data—including simulation fidelity, the distribution of atomic structures, and the distribution of imaging conditions—affect model performance across three benchmark experimental {HRTEM} image datasets. Using our workflow, we are able to achieve state-of-the-art segmentation performance on these experimental benchmarks and, further, we discuss robust strategies for consistently achieving high performance with machine learning in experimental settings using purely synthetic data. Construction Zone and its documentation are available at https://github.com/lerandc/construction\_zone.},
